# Configuration for the Null Platform Agent
# This section defines the environment variables that will be stored in a Kubernetes Secret
# and made available to the agent container at runtime
configuration:
  # Whether to create the configuration secret automatically
  # Set to false if you want to manage the secret externally
  create: true

  # Environment variables for the Null Platform Agent
  # These values will be stored in a Kubernetes Secret and injected into the container
  # More information about Kubernetes Secrets: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/
  values:
    # Tags to identify and categorize this agent instance
    # Used for filtering and organizing agents in the Null Platform dashboard
    # Example: "environment:prod,team:backend,region:us-east-1"
    AGENT_TAGS: ""

    # DEBUG provides verbose logging useful for troubleshooting

    # Additional environment variables to be passed to command executors
    # Format: "KEY1=value1,KEY2=value2"

    # Git repositories containing scopes and configurations for the agent
    # Format: "https://repo1.git#branch,https://token@repo2.git#branch"
    # The agent will clone these repositories to execute commands and apply configurations
    #example:
    #AGENT_AGENT_REPO: "https://repo_01.git#main,https://token@repo_02.git#main"
